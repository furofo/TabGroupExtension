Google TabGroups


Use the chrome.tabs API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to 
create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.


So chrome.tabs is an API, good way to think of it is a like a library of functions and objects and methods on objects
tat you can use. So for instance chrome.tabs.group (lets you create and manage tab groups is a method or function)

chrome.tabGroups.query() is function takes two arguments obj with key value pairs that chrome searches for  and a call back function that uses the objects it finds
ins some way

The objects have folling proprerties
collapse: boolean true false
color: string for color value
id: some number unique identifier of some sort?
title: title of the group'
windowId: another identifier possibly for current window???


chrome.tabs handles all indiviual tab functions is where you go to manager, and put tabs in gropus too
takes object as hanlder and does a promise with tab id or group of tab ids as argument can add with chrome.tabs.group(obj with right key value).then to do


Right now, my code looks for john and creates a new tab group with new color each time john is found.
Separate logic for storing things in google sync looks like.
